# Homepage template

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Using your previously designed patterns create the homepage for your eCommerce website.
- Create a new folder named `pages` and put the single new HTML file in there, name it `index.html` or `home.html`
- *You should only write HTML, copy-and-paste pattern code & insert appropriate classes like `.grid` and type sizes.*
- **Your homepage does not get its own CSS file.** If you cannot create the page without writing CSS, your patterns aren’t good enough. Go back to the patterns and add variations. Or make a brand new pattern.
- Be sure to link every CSS file for all the patterns into the top of this single HTML. This is exactly why it’s super important that your patterns do not target HTML tags directly because at this point there **will** be collisions.
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
